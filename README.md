# `maars` - an `R` implementation of Models As Approximations

The goal of the `maars` package is to implement the *Models As
Approximations* series of statistics papers (Buja, Brown, Berk, et al.
2019) and (Buja, Brown, Kuchibhotla, et al. 2019). This package was
inspired by the fantastic series of lectures by [Prof. Arun Kumar
Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/) and [Prof. Andreas
Buja](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja/), as part of the **“STAT
36761: Modern Linear Regression”** course at Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) in Fall 2020.

## Installation and User Guide
