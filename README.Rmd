# `maar` `R` implementation of Models As Approximations

The goal of the `maar` package is to implement the *Models As Approximations* series of
statistics papers. This package was inspired by the fantastic series of
lectures by [Prof. Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/)
and [Prof. Andreas Buja](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja/), 
as part of the __"STAT 36761: Modern Linear Regression"__ course 
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2020.
