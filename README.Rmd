# maar

The goal of the `maar` package is to implement the *Models As Approximations* series of
statistics papers. This package was inspired by the fantastic
__"STAT 36761: Modern Linear Regression"__ course taught by 
[Prof. Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2020.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shamindras/maar")

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
