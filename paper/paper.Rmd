abstract: >
  Linear regression using ordinary least squares (OLS) 
  is a critical part of a statistician's
  toolkit. In \pkg{R}, this is elegantly implemented 
  via the \code{lm()} and related functions. However, this functionality is based on the 
  unrealistic assumption that the linear model is well-specified. A large 
  body of econometric and statistical research has focused on performing OLS inference under 
  more practical assumptions. There is a need for a comprehensive workflow in $\pkg{R}$
  for OLS under these practical assumptions. In this paper, we introduce our \pkg{R} package \pkg{maars}, 
  to enable a \textit{tidy} inferential workflow in the misspecified OLS setting. Under potential 
  misspecification, we demonstrate how the \pkg{maars} package performs variance estimation, 
  confidence interval computation, hypothesis testing, and diagnostics. The outputs of \pkg{maars} 
  functions are tailored for further exploration using the \pkg{tidyverse} \pkg{R} packages.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic LaTeX that you need to know to
create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

In general, don't use Markdown, but use the more precise LaTeX commands instead:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}

One exception is inline code, which can be written inside a pair of backticks
(i.e., using the Markdown syntax).

If you want to use LaTeX commands in headers, you need to provide a
`short-title` attribute. You can also provide a custom identifier if necessary.
See the header of Section \ref{r-code} for example.

# \proglang{R} code {short-title="R code" #r-code}

Can be inserted in regular R markdown block.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```

## Features specific to \pkg{rticles} {short-title="Features specific to rticles"}

* Adding short titles to section headers is a feature specific to \pkg{rticles}
(implemented via a Pandoc Lua filter). This feature is currently not supported
by Pandoc and we will update this template if 
[it is officially supported in the future](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4409).
* Using the `\AND` syntax in the `author` field to add authors on a new line.
This is a specific to the `rticles::jss_article` format.
